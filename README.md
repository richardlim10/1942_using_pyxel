# 1942_using_pyxel
While studying abroad this Fall Semester at the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, I've taken classes that have developed skills I will use in my career. One of the classes I took was a course titled Programming. One of the packages in PyCharm we used was Pyxel, a retro game engine.

For our final project, my partner and I were tasked to re-create a simplified version of the old arcade game 1942 using Pyxel. This was done by creating various methods that controlled different aspects of the game.
